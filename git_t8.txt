Tutorial Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKigarlryYA

Purpose: Figure out how to commit directly to the repository and skip staging area

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

git -am "Adding all files automatically to staging area and committing them"

'Essentially instead of doing "git add ." and then committing, we can just use this one
command without having to do "git add ." '

'This should only really be done if you want to add all the files in one go. If you want 
to commit individual files, this is not a good idea'
