Tutorial Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyoJiKnpl6w&t=39s

Purpose: Figure out how to move files and rename files in the git repository

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

git add home.txt

git rm git_t1.txt

git status

'git status will show us that we wanted to basically rename the file that is currently 
in the git repository by pretending to add a home.txt file and deleting the git_t1.txt'

git mv home.txt git_t1.txt

'We use this idea of moving a file is pretty much the same thing as renaming the file. It is
much easier than the method presented above'

git mv git_t1.txt FolderName/<newname.txt>

'Move this text file inside this folder with the given folder name'
'In the process you can also rename the file that you moved'
