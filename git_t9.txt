-- Git Command List and Purpose #9 --

Tutorial Video: Git Tutorial - 14 - Checkout this video (Git it?)
Tutorial Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL_U5SMoz50

Purpose: In case mistakes were made, we want to revert back to a good file copy from the repository

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

git checkout -- git_t9.txt

'Someone worked on this file and saved it, now when you attempt to do something. It isn't working correctly, 
you can revert back to a good committed copy from the git repository and restore it to that instead'

(Video did not discuss about what if that bad copy was sent in through as a commit, probably future video)
